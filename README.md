JRPNMachine
===========

A Java Reverse Polish Notation (postfix-notation) calculator. Has a terminal interface (Polonium) and eventually also a GUI interface (not yet implemented).

### About the JRPNMachine/Polonium project:
The project has two components:
+ [JRPNMachine](https://github.com/ArcticLight/JRPNMachine/tree/master/com/meteorcode/JRPNMachine) is a Java package that serves RPN calculator backend functions, with support for double and BigDecimal numbers.
+ [Polonium](https://github.com/ArcticLight/JRPNMachine/blob/master/Polonium.java) is a simple command-line interface for JRPNmachine, allowing a user to interact with a JRPNMachine calculator from the Unix command line
+ Polonium-G (not yet implemented) is a planned graphical user interface for JRPNMachine

### Usage
+ ```java polonium -help``` displays a help file
+ ```java polonium``` enters the Polonium command-line interface

### Current Release
 [Polonium 0.3RC1](https://github.com/ArcticLight/JRPNMachine/releases/v0.3-RC1)
